# LISTS AND CONDITIONALS EXERCISE

Practicing concepts of REACT-COMPLETE-GUIDE's Section 4: Working with Lists and Conditionals

## REQUIREMENTS

- Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph).
- Create a new component (=> ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop
- Inside the ValidationComponent, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimum length)
- Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box (=> display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid black).
- Render a list of CharComponents where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop.
- When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.

### Hint: Keep in mind that JavaScript strings are basically arrays!
